    Welcome to The Password Project! This project was created by four Swarthmore College students for our Fall 2023 SWE class! In 8
    weeks, we created a web app that allows students, IT professionals, and others to check passwords against various
    university password standards to see what standards their password meets and what standards it does not. This allows
    for these groups to use stronger passwords in their day-to-day keeping their private information safe. Our solution also
    provides IT professionals with a framework to research and standardize password policies and provides students with
    helpful guidelines to create more secure passwords.</p>
